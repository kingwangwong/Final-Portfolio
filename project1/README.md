## Competencies
### JF 2.5
- Can implement a responsive User Interface				
- In this group project I created the responsive React interface. I implemented the pagination, checkbox, and search functions. I did this by searching for suitable libraries to include within the project and testing the functions on the running site. This resulted in a website that can sort and filter results for ease of use. 

### JF 2.3
- Can develop effective user interfaces				
- I used my knowledge of graphic design to create an organized and visually pleasing interface. I separated the navigation functions to the top with links to the other pages of the app and the logout button. The left side of the interface has the filtering functions like checkboxes and search box. And at the bottom I put the pagination navigation buttons. This made the website neat and easy to use.
