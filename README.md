## Portfolio Introduction
- I worked in REVO (Revenue Assurance Online) team. REVO checks to make sure customers are receiving the correct promotions so customers that are missing promotions properly receive them. I also worked on the FWA (Fixed Wireless Access) system where we audit the accuracy of the FWA chargeback process, as well as service/billing promotions (which makes sure customers are not being overbilled or underbilled). I was tasked with SQL queries which needed to be cleaned up and then integrated into the RESTful API to fetch and export data. Afterwards I used Toad to verify the endpoints.
