## Competencies
### JF 3.6
- Can implement a RESTful API				
- During my time at the Verizon Apprenticeship, I was tasked with integrating SQL queries into the RESTful API so that data can be fetched and exported. I needed to format the SQL query to be usable with the API and then create constants, classes and a rowmapper for it to be functional to the service and controller class. By doing this I gained a deep understanding of the database. Having a hands-on approach to learning the RESTful API is effective as a learning experience. 

### JF 3.4
- Can create a logical and maintainable codebase				
- While working on the API I needed to make sure the code I was writing was as organized and legible as the rest of the code. I heeded my coworker's instructions and observed the programming style of the database. I also followed the company Git policy on branch structure and committing. With these actions I am able to be an efficient programmer that can contribute to the project.
