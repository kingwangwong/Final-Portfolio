## Competencies
### JF 1.5
- Can work effectively and contribute appropriately on a team to produce software 							
    This project was a group project where I contributed to the creation of the routes and the UI cards. While engaging my work I regularly met with teammates to discuss improvements to the project. We collectively decided on the changes we wanted to implement and followed proper git standard practices. This is how we effectively managed our project. 

### JF 1.6
- Can follow software designs and functional/technical specifications		
    In this project I used Bootstrap and several React libraries. I made sure to follow the documentation and research in the Stack Overflow forums for answers when I had difficulty adding in a feature. Following the documentation reduced the number of bugs in the project as I coded which in turn made for efficient programming.
